# Sample App Deployment with Route53 Application Recovery Controller

This is as example of adding ARC support to an app deployed using Regions as its Cell boundaries. Each Cell (Region) contains a replica of the application stack which includes an Application Load Balancer (ALB), EC2 Auto-Scaling Group (ASG), and DynamoDB.

The `main.tf` contains the application stack HCL but it is commented out because it is *only an example*. The sample app design was adapted from [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/running-recovery-oriented-applications-with-amazon-route-53-application-recovery-controller-aws-ci-cd-tools-and-terraform/).

```bash
terraform init
# determine which cidr to allow access to your ALBs
terraform apply -var 'allowed_ips=["1.2.3.4/32"]'
```
